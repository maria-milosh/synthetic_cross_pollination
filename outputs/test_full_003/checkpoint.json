  "phase4_summary": "## Street Maintenance and Pothole Repair (6 votes, 10.0%)\n1. Argument 4: With limited funds, targeted pothole repair and resurfacing deliver high-certainty, visible improvements that benefit most residents by reducing vehicle damage, improving transit reliability, and making streets safer while preventing costlier repairs later.\n2. Argument 6: Street maintenance is essential infrastructure that keeps commutes, deliveries, and emergency response moving, and it provides fast, measurable taxpayer benefits by reducing accident and vehicle-damage costs and avoiding delays.\n\n## Expanded Mental Health Services (26 votes, 43.3%)\n1. **Argument 6:** Gaps in community mental health care drive avoidable ED boarding, repeat crises, and safety risks; investing $500,000 in mobile crisis response, outpatient access, and post-discharge follow-up can quickly cut high-cost utilization while improving safety for patients, staff, and the public.\n2. **Argument 12:** Expanded mental health services prevent crises that otherwise spill into ERs, schools, and the justice system\u2014costing far more later\u2014and evidence-based community treatment and mobile crisis teams reduce repeat crises and improve safety; $500,000 can fund measurable capacity with transparent accountability.\n\n## Affordable Housing Preservation Fund (23 votes, 38.3%)\n1. Argument 9: Stable, affordable housing functions as an upstream public-health intervention that reduces preventable ER visits and worsening mental illness/chronic disease while improving adherence and continuity of care; preserving existing units is faster and more cost-effective than new construction.\n2. Argument 20: Preservation is high-leverage because once affordable homes are lost to speculation or deterioration, replacement costs far more and displacement is hard to reverse; a dedicated fund can deploy $500,000 through targeted, auditable tools (rehab, code compliance, acquisition) with measurable outcomes and reduced downstream strain on shelters, ERs, and public safety.\n\n## Public Safety and Violence Prevention Programs (1 votes, 1.7%)\n1. As a restaurant owner, I see how safety and the perception of safety directly affect whether people come out at night and whether staff feel secure getting to and from work. Funding evidence-based violence prevention\u2014like targeted outreach, better coordination with community groups, and problem-spot interventions\u2014can reduce incidents without creating a heavy-handed atmosphere. It\u2019s a practical investment that supports local businesses, employees, and neighborhood trust.\n\n## Public Spaces and Parks Improvement (4 votes, 6.7%)\n1. Argument 3: Park and public-space investments deliver broad, visible benefits across neighborhoods\u2014cooler microclimates, better stormwater management, and safer gathering areas\u2014often faster than major capital or service expansions. Smart, resilient design (native plantings, shade trees, flood-ready amenities) strengthens community resilience while supporting quality of life and local economic activity.\n2. Argument 2: Parks are free, everyday places where neighbors connect\u2014kids play, seniors walk, and community events happen without a cost barrier. With $500,000, practical upgrades like safer lighting, improved playgrounds, and maintenance can quickly make spaces more welcoming and widely used.\n",
